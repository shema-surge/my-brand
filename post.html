        <h1>Finally Master Next.js's Most Complex Feature - Caching</h1>
        <p>
          Next.js is an amazing framework that makes writing complex server
          rendered React apps much easier, but there is one huge problem.
          Next.js‚Äôs caching mechanism is extremely complicated and can easily
          lead to bugs in your code that are difficult to debug and fix. If you
          don‚Äôt understand how Next.js‚Äôs caching mechanism works it feels like
          you are constantly fighting Next.js instead of reaping the amazing
          benefits of Next.js‚Äôs powerful caching. That is why in this article I
          am going to break down exactly how every part of Next.js‚Äôs cache works
          so you can stop fighting it and finally take advantage of its
          incredible performance gains. Before we get started, here is an image
          of how all the caches in Next.js interact with one another. I know
          this is overwhelming, but by the end of this article you will
          understand exactly what each step in this process does and how they
          all interact.

        <p>
          Request Memoization is great for making your app more performant by
          preventing duplicate fetch request, but when it comes to caching data
          across requests/users it is useless. This is where the data cache
          comes in. It is the last cache that is hit by Next.js before it
          actually fetches your data from an API or database and is persistent
          across multiple requests/users. Imagine we have a simple page that
          queries an API to get guide data on a specific city
